Kel is an open source Platform as a Service (PaaS) from Eldarion, Inc. that
makes it easy to manage web application deployment and hosting through the
entire lifecycle from development through testing to production. It adds
components and tools on top of Kubernetes that help developers manage their
application infrastructure. Kel builds on Eldarion's 7+ years experience running
one of the leading Python and Django PaaSes.
